# World Happiness Report Analysis

This project analyzes data from the annual World Happiness Report, which ranks countries by their level of happiness and well-being. The data includes factors such as GDP, social support, and life expectancy, which are used to calculate a Happiness Score for each country.

The goal of this project is to explore the factors that contribute to happiness and identify patterns and trends in the data. The analysis includes visualizations such as scatter plots, bar charts and maps to help visualize the relationships between different variables.

The project also includes SQL queries to manipulate and aggregate the data, as well as DAX formulas for creating calculated measures in Power BI. The final report is presented in a Power BI dashboard, which allows users to interact with the data and explore the findings in more detail.

The main findings of the analysis are summarized in the conclusion section of the report, which provides insights into the factors that contribute to happiness at the country level. The project also includes recommendations for future research and analysis to further explore the relationship between happiness and other socioeconomic factors.
